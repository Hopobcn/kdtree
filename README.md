# kdtree
======

K-d tree implementation in C++ for NN and KNN search

Templated k-d tree example that makes use of boost geometry point
classes. The k-d tree is build in bulk and supports N dimensions.
The implementation contains a recursive and iterative nearest neihgbor implementation, 
and a recursive k-nearest neighbor search implementation.
